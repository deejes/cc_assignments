      I am a backend developer based out of Vancouver. 
      <br> <br>
      I have dabbled in coding for a while, using R for stats assignments in University, and python to solve Project Euler problems. Problem 1 was doable with Excel, but I needed something more powerful for everything else.
      <br><br>
      Doing some Udacity courses introduced me to CS, and I was hooked, and it was there that I developed a deep appreciation for algorithms and data structuers. I really enjoy writing effcient code that scales well. 
      <br><br>
      I trained a machine learning model to do sentiment analysis on text, and used to it to analyze tweets, and benchmarked using Google Cloud's NL API. I also have open pull requests to <a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit/pull/1837">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/stympy/faker/pull/992"> Faker</a>, a fake data generator.  
      <br><br>
      Please get in touch if you'd like to talk about any of my work, or if you have an interesting problem I can help solve.
